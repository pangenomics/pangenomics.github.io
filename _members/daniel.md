I studied bioinformatics at the University of Frankfurt (Germany) before moving to the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg (Germany) for my PhD studies with Peer Bork (2009-2013) with a focus on the human microbiome and the development of methods for its analysis. For my postdoctoral studies, I moved to the University of Hawaii to work with Ed DeLong on microbial communities in the Oceans in 2014. In 2019, I started my own research group at the Amsterdam UMC studying the role, evolution and biology of the (human) microbiome as well as pathogens within the Laboratory for Applied Evolutionary Biology.
