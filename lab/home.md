The Microbial Pangenomics Lab studies the evolution and biology of microbes and their communities using (meta)-genomics and pangenome inspired computational analysis tools. The group is led by Daniel Mende. We seek a better understanding of the biological principles behind microbial evolution and host/environment-microbe interactions. We are specialized in metagenomics and genomics analyses and their integration with other data types. We are further involved in the development of state-of-the-art methods for metagenomics data analysis such as the mOTUs tool and the proGenomes database. In a world, where sequencing data has become ubiquitous, our vision is to combine local expertise with global data to understand the mechanisms and underlying evolutionary history of our relationship with our microbial companions and opponents.
