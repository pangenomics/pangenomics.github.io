[mOTUs](https://motu-tool.org/) is a metagenomic taxonomic profiler which used phylogenetic markers (MGs) are genes that can also be used to reconstruct the evolutionary history of organisms. mOTUs used 10 to taxonomically profile shotgun metagenomes, to quantify metabolically active members in metatranscriptomics and to quantify differences between strain populations using single nucleotide variation (SNV) profiles. One benefit of this methodology is that the MGs can be extracted from genomes and metagenomes to profile prokaryotes without a reference genome. At the moment more than 33 thousand species level mOTUs from 23+ environments can be profiled.
