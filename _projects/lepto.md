Pathogenic Leptospira cause approximately 1 million cases of Leptospirosis and 60 thousand deaths per year. In collaboration with the Leptospirosis Reference Centre at the AUMC, we are investigating the evolution and genome biology of different Leptospira species. Here, we are combining large scale genome sequencing, publicly available genomics data, and phenotyping with state-of-the-art pangenome, genomics and phylogenomics analyses to gain novel insight into the epidemiology and biology pg this pathogen.
