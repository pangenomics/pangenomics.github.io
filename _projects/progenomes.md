[proGenomes](https://progenomes.embl.de/) is a curated database of high-quality microbial genomes that are taxonomically and functionally annotated. The current proGenomes v2.1 version provides 84,096 consistently annotated bacterial and archaeal genomes from over 12000 species. These can be interactively explored and downloaded, whereby subsets can be customized e.g. taxonomic clades, representatives of each species or habitat-specific subsets. For each species cluster, precomputed pangenomes are available.
