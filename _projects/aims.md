name: Data Analysis for Amsterdam Infant Microbiome Study

We are involved in the Amsterdam Infant Microbiome Study [AIMS](https://aimsonderzoek.nl/?lang=en). AIMS is large scale, longitudinal study of the microbiome of up to 1000 infants and their families at different bodysites (oral, gut and skin samples). Our main role within AIMS is the analysis of metagenomics and other -omics sequencing data. This will include the investigation of strain transmission within families and factors important for childhood obesity by integrating diet and other metadata describing the infants and their living situation.
